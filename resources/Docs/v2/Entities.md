# Entities

All players, enemies and moveable objects extend the Entity type.

Entities can have components and sub-entities.

## Components

Components cover anything that is 'owned' by the entity and can be simple stat modifiers or 
even inventories

* [Inventories](Inventory.md)

## Sub-entities

Sub-entities are reserved for things like projectiles and spell effects {unconfirmed}
