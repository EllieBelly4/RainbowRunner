# TODO

- [ ] Add real inventory space simulation (disallow overlaps)
- [ ] Refactor inventory items, add a wrapper for all inventory items e.g. `InventoryItem` contains `Equipment`
- [ ] Parse all item mod counts from config
- [ ] All floats that need to be synchronised need to be stored as uint32 for deterministic behaviour
- [ ] Fix crash on RRSpy when clicking through Avatar parents
- [ ] (Eventually) Add range check when client requests Activate
