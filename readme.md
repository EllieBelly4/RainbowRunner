# Rainbow Runner

Private server + tools for Dungeon Runners.

This is very much a work in progress and is not close to completion and definitely not user friendly.
## Requirements

* Golang >=1.18 - Server + CLI tools
* [ANTLR](https://www.antlr.org/index.html) - Generating config parser from language file([antlr/DRConfig.g4]())

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome, the focus right now is to get everything working, don't try to make major refactor PRs, I'm aware the codebase is a mess.

1. Fork
2. Open PR
3. Get approved and merge!
